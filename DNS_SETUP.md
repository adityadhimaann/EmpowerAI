# DNS Configuration for empowerai.dev

## üåê Quick Setup Guide

Your domains have been successfully added to Vercel! Now you need to configure DNS records in Name.com.

### Step 1: Login to Name.com
1. Go to [name.com](https://name.com)
2. Login to your account
3. Find your domain: `empowerai.dev`
4. Click "Manage DNS" or "DNS Records"

### Step 2: Add These DNS Records

**Delete any existing A or CNAME records for @ and www first, then add:**

| Type | Host | Value           | TTL  |
|------|------|-----------------|------|
| A    | @    | 76.76.21.21    | 3600 |
| A    | www  | 76.76.21.21    | 3600 |

**Alternative (CNAME approach) - Use this if you prefer:**

| Type  | Host | Value                | TTL  |
|-------|------|----------------------|------|
| A     | @    | 76.76.21.21         | 3600 |
| CNAME | www  | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |

### Step 3: Save and Wait
- Save your DNS changes
- Wait 10-60 minutes for DNS propagation
- You'll receive an email from Vercel when verification is complete

### Step 4: Test Your Domain
After DNS propagation:
- Visit: https://empowerai.dev
- Visit: https://www.empowerai.dev
- Both should show your EmpowerAI app!

### Verification Script
Run this to check your domain setup:
```bash
./scripts/verify-domain.sh
```
